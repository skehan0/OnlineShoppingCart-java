# OnlineShoppingCart-java
Your goal is to create and run
two test scenarios to demonstrate the functionality of the shopping cart transaction classes.
  1. The first scenario is the scenario covered in the lecture session.
  2. The second scenario is a slight variation of the first:
  a. The user adds three items
  b. Requests a display of the shopping cart items and total
  c. Removes one item
  d. Confirms the cart and makes an order
  e. The user submits a payment, however, the payment is not valid
  f. The user is sent a regret email notifying them that the order was unsuccessful
